Icons for Final Project

# Outline Summary


## Gabriela Schulman


I am basing my final project off of my initial icon system theme, theater and the stage. My idea is to make the home page and interactive stage from a birds-eye view, allowing the user to click on the text labeling the name of that stage direction to take the user to a corresponding page. The Upstage webpage, which is the one I have outlined, will be a Backdrop for the set using custom icons with animations, image overlays, sound, and a video background. The Downstage page will be a usage of animation and transitions to show spotlights moving and shining their light (all icons/paths) around the screen. The Center Stage page will involve using my initial icon system, a system of symbols actors, directors, and stage managers, use to draw out blocking, as a dictionary. If someone hovers over the icon, you will be able to see what it stands for. I will be adding more symbols to the previous ones I have used.
